		<p> <h3> THE CHALLENGE</h3></p>
		<p>Dami was six years old when an aneurysm claimed the life of her dad. Derrick was nine 
		when his father died of heart disease. Jeannie was seven when her mom passed away
		after a year-long battle with ovarian cancer.<sup>*</sup></p>
		
		<p>All too soon, these three young people were confronted with the death of a loved one. Have
		you had a similar experience? if so, this article can help you come to terms with your loss.<sup>#</sup>
		First, though, consider a few facts about grieving.</p>
		
		<hr>
		<p class="small_content">
		<sup>*</sup>You can also read about the experiences of Dami, Derrick, and Jeannie in the article that
		follows this one.
		<sup>#</sup>Although this article is about the death of a parent, the principles discussed also apply too the death of a sibling or a friend.

			<p> <h4>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</h4></p>
			
			<P><strong>There are many ways to grieve.</strong> This means that the way you express your sorrow might 
			differ from the way others do so."Coping with a death does not follow a simle pattern or set
			of rules," says the book <em>Helping Teens Cope With Death.</em> The important thing is that you do not unduly suppress your grief. Why? Because...</p>
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Suppressing grief can be harmful.</strong> Jeannie, mentioned at the outset, says: "i thought ihad to be strong for y little sisiter, so i buried my emotions. Even today,i tend to 
			suppress painful feelings and that's not healthy"</p>
			
			
			
			<p>Experts would agree. "Feelings denied or bottled up won't stay bottled up forever," says the book <em>The Grieving Teen.</em> "They will return when you least expect[them to]in the form of emotional flare-ups or physical aliments."
			
			Suppressed grief can also lead to the abuse of alcohol or drugs, all done in an effort to numb the pain.
			</p>
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Grieving may be accompanied by confusing emotions.</strong> For example, some people feel anger at the person who died, feeling that the person "abandoned" them. Others blame God, thnking thta he should have prevented the death. Many who grieve feel guilt for things they did or said to the person, since there is now no way to make amends.
		
			</p>
			
			
			
			<p> Clearly, grieving can be a complex process. How can you get relief and be helped to move forward?
