			<font style="color:#798DA5; font-weight:bold">WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS</font> Jesus was executed "by hanging on a tree."(Acts 5:30, <em> The New Jerusalem Bible</em>) Both of the words used by the Bible writers to describe the instrument of Jesus' death suggest one piece of wood, not two. the Greek word <em>stau<sup>.</sup>ros</em>, according to <em>Crucifixion in Antiquity,</em> means "a pole i the broadest sense. It is not the equivalent of a 'cross.'"

				The Christian apostle Paul wrote that Jesus beame "a curse instead od us, becouse it is written: 'Accursed is every man hung<br /> upon a stake[<em>xy'lon</em>]"(Galatians 3:13)Paul thus indicated that Jesus died on a sake - a single piece of wood.
